# Java Raytracer demo

Everyone needs to write a raytracer, right?

So this is a simple real-time raytracer written in Java with a Swing-based interactive UI. It's CPU-only, doesn't use OpenGL, and doesn't use GPU acceleration. Move the camera with WASD,
zoom with = and -, and quit with Q or ESC. The scene features 5 colored spheres arranged in a circle, a ground plane, 
and multiple light sources (point, directional, and ambient).

The project is just a prototype, and doesn't do proper double buffering. That's why there can be some artifacts
during redrawing.

## Features

- Scene with multiple spheres, ground, and lights.
